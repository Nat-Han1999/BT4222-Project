# Project Title: Predicting S&P500 Index Trend Using Sentiment Analysis


# Project Description

This project aims to analyse the correlation between sentiments from various internet sources (Twitter, Reddit and Financial news) and the S&P 500 Index. Our group’s hypothesis is that good sentiments observed in social media platforms as well as financial news sites would positively correlate with an upward trend in the S&P 500 Index. 

## Introduction & Motivation

Predicting the prices of stocks remains popular amongst traders, institutional investors, and retail investors alike, as they race to find ways to beat the market to profit. Sentiment analysis is one of the methods used to predict stock market prices.

More than half of the world now uses social media1. Sentiment in the news seems to move markets as seen in examples such as a jump in Bitcoin’s value by 20% after Elon Musk included "#bitcoin" to his Twitter bio2, the 2020 Covid-19 stock market crash3 when fear, uncertainty and turmoil flooded the news, the 2021 WallStreetBets saga with GameStop (AMC)4 where Redditors teamed up to take on institutional investors by shorting the stock, and more recently in the U.S. CPI (Consumer Price Index) Reports.
